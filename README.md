# Azure Cloud Capstone Projects

This repository contains **capstone cloud infrastructure projects** built in a **controlled Azure sandbox environment** with enforced **policy and RBAC restrictions**.

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate **infrastructure design thinking**, **operational discipline**, and **decision-making under constraints**, rather than unrestricted or idealized deployments.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

These projects are designed to showcase:

- Practical Azure infrastructure skills (IaaS + selected PaaS)
- Terraform-based infrastructure provisioning
- Networking, Storage, and Compute fundamentals
- Engineering judgment when operating under real-world limitations

This mirrors conditions commonly found in:
- Enterprise environments
- Training and internal sandboxes
- Shared cloud subscriptions


---

## 🔒 Environment Constraints (Intentional)

All projects were built under the following constraints:

- Pre-created resource groups
- Custom Role RBAC permissions 
- Enforced Azure policies
- Limited region and SKU availability
- No owner-level access

These constraints influenced design choices and are treated as **inputs**, not blockers.
