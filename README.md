# Azure Cloud Capstone Projects

A collection of **Azure infrastructure capstone projects** built in a **restricted sandbox environment** with enforced **policy and RBAC constraints**.

These projects focus on **design judgment and operational thinking under constraints**, not idealized deployments.

## 🎯 What This Repository Demonstrates
- Azure infrastructure fundamentals (IaaS + selected PaaS)
- Terraform-based provisioning and state management
- Networking, storage, and compute design basics
- Practical decision-making in constrained environments

## 🔒 Environment Constraints (Intentional)
All projects were built with:
- Pre-created resource groups
- Custom RBAC roles (no owner access)
- Enforced Azure policies
- Limited regions and SKUs

Constraints are treated as **inputs**, not blockers.
